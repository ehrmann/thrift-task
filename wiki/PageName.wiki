= Thriftc Ant Task =

Thriftc-task is an native(ish) cross-platform Ant task for the Apache Thrift projects.

== Usage ==
  # Put thriftc_task.jar into your project directory.
  # Define the task in your build file, setting classpath to the relative path to the jar:
{{{
<taskdef name="thriftc" classname="com.nsegment.thrift.ThriftcTask" classpath="thriftc_task_optimized.jar"/>
}}}
  # Now add a task to your build file:
{{{
<thriftc srcdir="." includes="**/*.thrift" destdir="bin" java=""/>
}}}
  # This task will build all {{{.thrift}}} files in the project directory and drop off {{{.java}}} files in {{{bin/gen-java}}}

== Limitations ==
  * The source and destination directors must be somewhere within the project root directory.  Doing {{{srcdir="../"}}} will cause a build exception.
